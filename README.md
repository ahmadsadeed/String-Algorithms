# String-Algorithms
Algorithms on Strings by University of California San Diego &amp; National Research University Higher School of Economics

This course is part four of the Algorithms and Data Structure specialization. Although we recommend signing up for the entire specialization, you still can take this class separately if you haven't taken the previous parts yet.

In a few years, you may have your genome sequenced in a doctorâ€™s office as a part of a routine medical procedure. But how can your doctor find mutations that make your genome different from other genomes and figure out which of them are implicated in diseases? Algorithmically, this problem is not very different from tasks you face every day: spell-checking your documents or searching internet. In this course, you will learn about suffix trees, suffix arrays, and other brilliant algorithmic ideas that help doctors to find differences between genomes and power lighting fast internet searches.
